### The Ask
A Series B-funded, touchscreen technology component provider asked frog to translate its compelling technology capabilities into a digital collaboration product for the modern workplace. At the time Microsoft had just launched Surface Hub. Our clientâ€™s technology had the potential to offer a radically more affordable alternative with superior touch technology.

### What are the modes and types of collaboration?
We started with two questions: how do teams collaborate? what types of collaboration are most under-served by existing solutions?
During research, we spent time observing teams across organizations of all sizes and types and based on this research, we identified four collaboration typologies to frame our brainstorming.

### Three Concepts for Digital Collaboration
From there, we created three conceptual directions, Concierge, Portal and Campfire. For each concept, we created sample positioning, customer types, and key signature features.
