**DRAFT COMING**

`Anyone can create` 

GenAI will dramatically reduce the barriers to creativity. I don't mean creativity in the sense of the creative profession (i.e. designers and artists) although it will have tremendous impact there too. I mean creativity in the sense of the act of creation - the ability to envison and realize an idea - your own idea - independently. 
  
`Curiosity is all you need` 

It starts with curiosity. 

For me, LLMs (and in particular GPT) have sparked a new enthusiasm and energy for learning and creation. Any topic, any thread, any thought, any idea has the potential to be realized if you are curious enough to see it through.

In high school, I was given a science award for being the most inquisitive. I would often annoy teachers with my questions - some of which were dumb, sometimes repetitive, and perhaps distracting - but they were an essential part of the way I learned. My questions were my brain trying to form and validate my mental model of a concept. GPT is a teacher with no boundaries. It doesn't judge, it comes along with you on your learning journey and it never tires. Need more examples? Need analogies to help you connect the dots? GPT will tailor its explanation of concepts to your context. 

Over a period of six weeks, I built six prototypes starting with basic scripts and culminating in a full stack news summarization app that used reinforcement learning with human feedback, a React front end, python backend, a SQL database and integrations with several external APIs including NewsAPI and OpenAI. See my posts [Three ways I played with OpenAI's APIs]({{< relref "/projects/ThreeWaysLLMs/index.md" >}}) and [Experiments in Supervised and Reinforcement Learning]({{< relref "/projects/LearningExperiments/index.md" >}})

GPT enabled me to explore and build on my own - without relying on youtube videos or tutorials. My only tool was curiosity, patience to iterate my prompts so that GPT or co-pilot eventually understood my intent and questioning GPT when it make a recommendation that didn't totally make sense.

As an example of how different it is for a non-technical person to build something now versus in pre-GenAI. In 2019, I built my personal website using Gatsby by following a tutorial and scrolling through stackoverflow with great frustration. It probably took me three weeks in total (including content creation etc) to get it to a place where I was happy. 

Contrast that experience to this website which I built using Hugo - which took me three days with no tutorial, no instructions, just Github Copilot. I was able to customize an existing [theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/archie/), streamline the deployment process with with Github actions and also added fun little elements like the [Typed.JS](https://mattboldt.com/demos/typed-js/) animation on the homepage.

`Prompting is fun and a process` 
This is how I used GPT
- Step 1: Prompt it to brainstorm and ask follow up questions. In all of my projects, I would start with a vague idea with some aspect of AI technology that I wanted to learn (for exmaple: " ")
  - GPT is extraodinarily good at coming up with thought provoking ideas.
- Step 2: Partner with GPT to help make your idea more concrete. This usually was an iterative process. You want to get to a place where GPT understands the goal of the project so that you can basically create a product spec.
- Step 3: Create a product spec with the help of GPT that articulates the features of the project. GPT can help you brainstorm what are the most important aspects based on Step 2.
- Step 4: Prompt GPT to help you create a tech / architecture spec. As part fo this process, you will need to give it some more context about your technical know-how, time commitment and also whether this app is a proof of concept. 
- Step 5: Iterate on the tech spec to ensure that it meets your level. Give it context about yourself so that it can tailor the best way to implment. 
- Step 6: Start implementation but ask GPT to help you decide where to start. 
MORE TO COME.

If you need more guidance tell it. 
GPT can tailor its response to the way you want to learn.
