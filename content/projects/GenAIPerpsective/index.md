**DRAFT COMING**

# Anyone can create

`GenAI will dramatically reduce the barriers to creativity.` I don't mean creativity in the sense of the creative profession (i.e. designers and artists) although it will have tremendous impact there too. I mean creativity in the sense of the act of creation - the ability to envison and realize an idea - your own idea - independently. 
  
# Curiosity is all you need

It starts with curiosity. 

For me, GPT has sparked a new enthusiasm and energy for learning and creation. Any topic, any thread, any thought, any idea has the potential to be realized if you are curious enough to see it through.

In high school, I was given a science award for being the most inquisitive. I would often annoy teachers with my questions - some of which were dumb, sometimes repetitive, and perhaps distracting - but they were an essential part of the way I learned. My questions were my brain trying to form and validate my mental model of a concept. GPT is a teacher with no boundaries. It doesn't judge, it comes along with you on your learning journey and it never tires. Here are a few ways I have prompted GPT to help me understand an idea: 
1. Give me an example. (a simple tactic that can you can easily continue to modify to simpler and simpler examples)
2. Give me an analogy (GPT helped me understand the difference between policy driven and reward driven reinforcement learning algorithms through the lens of cooking)
3. Tell me the space in which this concept exists. (a tactic that I use frequently when I'm trying to situate and determine the level of the concept)
4. Ask it to validate a hypothesis (a tactic that I use when the picture is beginning to clear but I need better language to articulate it)
5. Give more context about yourself (this is an obvious one - which is tell it more about the reason why you're trying to learn and anything relevant about yourself so that it can tailor its response)

# From three weeks to three days

As an example of how different it is for a non-technical person to build something now versus in pre-GenAI. In 2019, I built my personal website using Gatsby by following a tutorial and scrolling through stackoverflow with great frustration. To get to a reasonable stopping point where I felt it was presentable, it probably took me three weeks in total (including content creation etc).

Contrast that experience to this website which I built using Hugo - which took me three days with no tutorial, no instructions, just Github Copilot. I was able to customize an existing [theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/archie/), streamline the deployment process with with Github actions and also added fun little elements like the [Typed.JS](https://mattboldt.com/demos/typed-js/) animation on the homepage.

Over the last six weeks, I've built eight prototypes starting with basic scripts and culminating in a full stack news summarization app that used reinforcement learning with human feedback, a React front end, python backend, a SQL database and integrations with several external APIs including NewsAPI and OpenAI. See my posts [Three ways I played with OpenAI's APIs]({{< relref "/projects/ThreeWaysLLMs/index.md" >}}) and [Experiments in Supervised and Reinforcement Learning]({{< relref "/projects/LearningExperiments/index.md" >}})

GPT enabled me to explore and build on my own - without relying on videos or tutorials. 

My only tools were 1. `curiosity`, 2. `patience` and 3. `healthy skepticism`. I've already written about curiosity above. Patience is required to iterate through a prompt and its generated response until you achieve what you're looking for. This process is actually quite fun compared to mindlessly scrolling through stackoverflow forums. The healthy skepticism is required to ensure you don't blindly follow GPT's instructions because it does indeed make mistakes.

# Treat Prompting like a Game 

This is how I used GPT
- Step 1: Prompt it to brainstorm and ask follow up questions. In all of my projects, I would start with a vague idea with some aspect of AI technology that I wanted to learn (for exmaple: " ")
  - GPT is extraodinarily good at coming up with thought provoking ideas.
- Step 2: Partner with GPT to help make your idea more concrete. This usually was an iterative process. You want to get to a place where GPT understands the goal of the project so that you can basically create a product spec.
- Step 3: Create a product spec with the help of GPT that articulates the features of the project. GPT can help you brainstorm what are the most important aspects based on Step 2.
- Step 4: Prompt GPT to help you create a tech / architecture spec. As part fo this process, you will need to give it some more context about your technical know-how, time commitment and also whether this app is a proof of concept. 
- Step 5: Iterate on the tech spec to ensure that it meets your level. Give it context about yourself so that it can tailor the best way to implment. 
- Step 6: Start implementation but ask GPT to help you decide where to start. 
MORE TO COME.

If you need more guidance tell it. 
GPT can tailor its response to the way you want to learn.
