Over the last two months, I worked with two technical co-founders (whom I connected with on YC co-founder platform) to find a compelling problem space, product concept and attractive market.

The two technical founders had incredible academic and professional credentials having worked at all the big tech names but they had limited exposure to real-world business problems. However, they seemed eager to learn. I led them on a 7 week journey of customer discovery, providing them access to my network. We spoke to over 30 customers over this time period, honing in where we wanted to focus our product development efforts. Because we were all starting from a blank slate, there was no established vision. Through our discovery process, we found interesting insights and an extremely technically challenging and unsolved problem area that everyone on the team was excited to work on. 

We then took this unsolved problem area and applied to a well known incubator, got to the final rounds of their diligence process and then also received a YC interview for this upcoming batch in 2024. However, we decided to part ways minutes before receiving the invitation to interview.

## What happened and where did we go wrong?

When we first started talking, we immediately spent time aligning on questions related to roles, responsibilities, equity split. We spent time aligning on our mutual passion areas and problem spaces. We spent time aligning on why we wanted to start a company. Basically all the easy, somewhat perfunctory things to align on.

All seemed great. However, as soon as we got into the weeds of product development, working with customers, and staying accountable to each other - we realized that we were actually quite misaligned. Here are some of the takeaways from my experience:
 
## Takeaway 1: Build together (ALOT) before applying together

My two co-founders were really keen on getting into a well known incubator. As the CEO and non-technical co-founder, I was happy to weave a great story, problem, market, founder-market story to convince pre-seed investors/incubators to bet on us. We were able to do this very credibly. However, at some point, getting into an incubator became more important than building a product, business and team. Collaborating on an application is not a good way to test out a team’s compatibility. The only way to know is to build something together that has some stakes to it. To give ourselves some credit, we did try to test this but it was only over a week and didn’t have sufficient stakes. The misalignment only began to appear when we started with customers (which I’m not sure how to de-risk in the future).

## Takeaway 2: Regularly reassess founder-market fit 

As we narrowed in on our problem and market space, we did not regularly reassess whether we had the right set experiences, skills and network to be successful in the market we were targeting. On paper, I think we could spin a great story, but I’m unsure whether we could demonstrate that our team was greater than the sum of its parts. Our team had the right hard skills across each of the functions in engineering, sales, product, and marketing. But I wonder whether our team had enough overlap in experiences to be able to succeed. When I had initially been searching for co-founders, I was looking for people with very different experiences and skills than mine which I still believe is critical. But coming out of this experience, I realize some degree of overlap is quite important because it establishes a shared language and ways of working that otherwise need to be learned (which I address in my last takeaway).

## Takeaway 3: [ fragile ]

I did not fully appreciate how fragile a team is in its infancy. No external force is holding it together beyond each individual’s commitment. How do you assess each person’s grit to make it work? I have worked successfully on many teams. I’ve been on challenging teams and helped turn them around into high performing teams. So when I began to see potential issues with our team’s compatibility, I felt confident that I could make it work because at frog, we were literally trained to adapt to differences. However, I’ve now realized that those situations were in the context of an existing organization that was keeping the team together implicitly in the background. Here in the fragile state of early entrepreneurship, there was nothing holding us together. So when the first issues start appearing, only the team’s grit to make it work is binding you together.

## Moving Forward

Going through this process was a remarkable experience. I’ve reflected on some of the characteristics I’m going to look out for next if I continue to pursue entrepreneurship. It’s comprised of three layers: Table stakes, Founder-Market Fit, and Grit Orientation.


Table stakes
The basis for working together. Table stakes to start working together.
Passions: What are you interested in building? What are your domain interests? What problem areas are you solving? What industries are you interested in?
Purpose: Why are you starting a company? What do you think about the responsibilities of taking on venture capital and what this entails?
Practices: How do you collaborate? How do you express and get feedback on your ideas? How do you plan? What keeps you accountable? How do you handle pressure? How do you share your work?

Founder-Market Fit
The alignment between the team’s tangible assets and the needs of the target market. The assets should be worth more together than the sum of the parts. 
Experiences: Does the team have professional experiences valuable to the target market? Have you seen the problems in prior roles? Do you know the competition? Is there overlap in the team members’ experiences to create shared language?
Skills: Does the team have the range of hard and soft skills to build a solution for the market? Different technical skills, marketing/sales skills, customer relationship etc?
Network: Does the team have relevant networks of potential customers, employees, and partners to succeed in the market? 

Grit Orientation 
Characteristics of the team to both break through barriers and follow through on commitments 
Perseverance: Adapts, takes initiative to move projects forward regardless of obstacles
Commitment: Deep commitment often reflected in personal sacrifices.
Resilience: Emotional strength to endure stress and challenges without breaking focus.
Velocity: Speed of learning, development and progress
Other areas I’m going to explicitly look out for: curiosity, optimism, initiative, flexibility
