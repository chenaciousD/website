### The Ask
A leading US telco asked frog to envision the company’s future end to end customer experience. The telco had recently acquired new media/content assets that increased its competitive advantage, enabling it to offer a richer suite of products and content to customers.

### The Process
The frog team was comprised of interaction designers, visual designers, and strategists. My role on the team included:

- Lead customer research and synthesis of findings
- Generate brainstorming and ideation framework for new product/experience features
- Business case validation for new concepts
- Contribute to concepting and articulation of signature moments
- Narrative creation and storyboarding for animated shorts

Our participatory design research process included speaking with 25 customers, visiting their homes to understand their painpoints and needs. We created several activities to help surface open conversation during our interviews.

### The Outcome
A key insight from our customer research was the lack of trust between consumers and the telco brand. Consumers felt that they had a very adversarial relationship with the brand. We delivered a framework to rebuild trust with consumers, a set of experience principles, 80+ differentiated concepts aligned to this framework.

#### A Framework & Service Principles for Building Trust
We created a framework for building trust with different behavioral segments: the Independent, the Control Seeker, the Attention Seeker and Delegator. We synthesized core painpoints and converted them into feature-rich opportunity areas for the brand’s product and customer experience.

We applied the Trust framework, Customer Journey Map (Learn-Buy-Get-Use-Pay-Service) and behavioral archetypes to generate and organize hundreds of concepts and ideas.
