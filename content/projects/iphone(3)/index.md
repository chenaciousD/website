A couple of months ago, I left Juniper Square where I joined as a product manager during the earliest days of covid. I want to thank Adam Ginsberg and Nir Rachmel for the wonderful time I spent there. I learned about the importance of considering blast radius, evaluating cultured butter vs regular butter, how to avoid a bad case of link-itis and had the term data model forever etched into my brain.

The difference between consulting on and building products is stark. You must sift through the noise of feedback from every direction, resolve tradeoffs that seem impossible, deeply understand the capabilities of inherited systems, have the patience to build enterprise grade software, and continue to motivate and inspire engineers. For this experience, I am grateful.
