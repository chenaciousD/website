### The Ask
Creator, an SF-based startup attempting to disrupt the industrialized food system, asked frog to design a mobile ordering and burger customization app that showcased its revolutionary machine. (Note: The machine itself was designed by noted automotive designer, Per Selvaag).

### The Process
The frog team was comprised of interaction designers, visual designers and strategists who collaborated to design the MVP version of Creator’s mobile ordering app. My role on the team included:
- Scoping, contracting and engagement account leadership
- Gather, document and prioritize product requirements and tradeoffs
- Design-Engineering collaboration and process model
- Contribute to task sequencing and overall project/product management
- Contribute to interaction model brainstorming and concept development


### The Outcome
frog designed the core experience of the MVP mobile app that is currently being used by Creator’s own burger concierge staff within the restaurant. Every element of the app - from the navigation to the persistent smart cart - was designed to maximize user delight and deliver business goals.

#### A Roadmap & Framework Oriented around Customer Needs
The three tab navigation - profile, featured meal menu, and ala carte menu are designed to directly facilitate the needs of our three archetypes: the efficiency maximizer, the explorer and the burger tinkerer.

For the burger tinkerers, we also created a tactile interaction “filtering” experience that visualizes, real-time, their personalized burger. For every burger element from pattie doneness to # of pickles to sauce proportion - users can tap, toggle, and slide their way to burger perfection.

Lastly, we delivered a set of marketing templates including the landing page with marketing copy and images of the machine, ingredients and burgers which were produced during a two day photo shoot with noted commercial food photographer, Aubrie Pick.
