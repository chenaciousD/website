## The Ask
A Series B-funded, touchscreen technology component provider asked frog to translate its compelling technology capabilities into a digital collaboration product for the modern workplace. At the time Microsoft had just launched Surface Hub. Our client’s technology had the potential to offer a radically more affordable alternative with superior touch technology.

## What are the modes and types of collaboration?
We started with two questions: how do teams collaborate? what types of collaboration are most under-served by existing solutions?
During research, we spent time observing teams across organizations of all sizes and types and based on this research, we identified four collaboration typologies to frame our brainstorming.

## Three Concepts for Digital Collaboration
From there, we created three conceptual directions, Concierge, Portal and Campfire. For each concept, we created sample positioning, customer types, and key signature features.

Each concept was designed to target a different type of collaboration:

- **Portal** is a remote team collaboration solution that creates a feeling of shared space by facilitating and encouraging moments of spontaneous co-creation, serendipity, and mutual understanding across time, space and culture. 
- **Concierge** is a high performance collaboration tool that augments your team’s brainstorming capabilities by serving as an intelligent brainstorming partner.
- **Campfire** is your teams’ control room, facilitating a sense of team belonging both physically and virtually. Campfire contextually updates its dashboard with real-time information, enabling your team to efficiently manage, prioritize and execute tasks.
