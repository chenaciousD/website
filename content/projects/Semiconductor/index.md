We started with a deep dive into the technology with subject matter experts. 
The steps:
- Step 1: What are the key areas of technological innovation
- Step 2: How do these innovation affect the category?
- Step 3: What's in it for the customer?
- Step 4: What are the features the deliver new value?
- Step 5: What does it all add up to for the customer?

Scroll through the above carousel to see the progression of synthesis.

The concept was launched via this [press release](https://thespoon.tech/nxp-is-trying-to-reinvent-rf-cooking-we-check-in-on-their-progress/). Since then several high end appliance brands such as Miele are now working on incorporating this technology into their appliance portfolio.
