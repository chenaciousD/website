## The Ask
An American semiconductor manufacturer approached to frog with a new microwave using Radio Frequency technology. frog was asked to help translate the technology into a consumer product experience that would help create a market for its technological innovation.

## The Process

This project involved industrial design, interaction  design, high level feature definition and business case analysis including market sizing and product positioning. 

## Humanizing Technology into Customer Benefits

The image carousel above walk through how we translated technology into a compelling consumer value prop: 

- Step 1: What are the areas of technological innovation
- Step 2: How do these innovations affect the category? 
- Step 3: What are the values for the customer?
- Step 4: What are potential features that support these values?
- Step 5: What does it all add up to for the customer?

The concept was launched via this [press release](https://thespoon.tech/nxp-is-trying-to-reinvent-rf-cooking-we-check-in-on-their-progress/). Since then several high end appliance brands such as Miele are now working on incorporating this technology into their appliance portfolio.
