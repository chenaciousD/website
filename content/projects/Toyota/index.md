### The Ask
In 2016, a leading Japanese automaker engaged frog to envision an AI concept car of the future by reconceptualizing the relationship between car and driver and leveraging emerging technologies such as AI, autonomous driving and new digital interfaces.

### The Process
The frog team was comprised of interaction designers, visual designers, film/motion animators, mechanical engineers, strategists and industrial designers. My role on the team included:
- Millennial consumer research
- Signature moment and concept development
- Car-driver narrative and AI personality definition
- Interaction and relationship model concept development
- Facilitation of key client workshops and activities

### The Outcome
frog delivered a differentiated concept, signature experiences, and a radical interaction model designed to evolve and grow.

#### Relationship Learning Model
Core to the concept was a relationship model based on primary research with millennials who stated that discovery and well-being were key motivators for meaning in the 21st century.

#### A Multi-modal, Decentralized Interaction Model
We developed a radically different interaction model that was able to move across the car in a “fairy” like fashion to “portals” within the interior and exterior of the vehicle.

Several partners were involved in bringing this concept to life which eventually launched publicly in 2017. In 2017, our client launched the concept at CES where it was also given a prestigious Best of CES award. The [concept](https://www.businessinsider.com/toyota-has-created-a-concept-car-with-ai-called-yui-2019-10) was a showcase piece for our client at the Tokyo Olympics in 2020.
