In 2019, I took a 2 month inspiration trip, traveling through Europe to investigate failed utopias and bicycles. Beyond the itinerary of the trip which I will later outline in this post. I wanted to write about two approaches that I took to this trip that I thought were interesting.

# Psychogeography and Dérive

> The sudden change of ambiance in a street within the space of a few meters; the evident division of a city into zones of distinct psychic atmospheres; the path of least resistance that is automatically followed in aimless strolls (and which has no relation to the physical contour of the terrain); the appealing or repelling character of certain places—these phenomena all seem to be neglected. In any case they are never envisaged as depending on causes that can be uncovered by careful analysis and turned to account.
— Guy Debord, Introduction to a Critique of Urban Geography
