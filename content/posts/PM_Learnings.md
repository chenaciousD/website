The following are some reflections and principles that I have taken away from my time being a product manager at a scaling startup. They are high level principles that are less about the nuts and bolts of designing and building products and more about the importance of the management aspects of the role.

## Adopt a "big tent" strategy üé™

In politics, the concept of a "big tent" refers to how a political party attracts a wide range of supporters from various backgrounds, beliefs, and ideologies, attempting to unite individuals under a broad coalition. I think PMs should have similar aspirations - to create a big tent for their initiatives that amass zealous support across an organization. 

You can apply a "big tent" approach across the product development cycle. Here are a few ways I brought people into my tent at Juniper Square: 
- `Good ideas come from anyone and anywhere` Open yourself up to ideas from all parts of the organization. Create a process that invites participation and engagement. 
- `Telegraph your voice` The PM is a very well positioned role because it by definition is networked across sales, success, support, engineering. Making sense of these signals is step one but evangelizing your synthesis so even more important. People need to know where you stand.
- `Multiply your voice with missionaries` Provide artifacts or create moments where you leverage others to share and promulgate your ideas. Ideas become stronger when they are not only conveyed by you but also repeated by others.

## The art of What If? ‚öñÔ∏è    

In design consulting, a common tactic to generate new ideas is called the What If technique (it's also known as ["how might we...")](https://www.frog.co/work/frogthink). The technique is used to help expand the scope of thinking, challenge existing rules, elicit more divergent ideas by lower the stakes and offering a hypothetical. This kind of What if is the fun and exploratory. This was the kind of What if that I was trained on at frog. Our clients paid us to think in this orientation.

But there is another kind of What if. The darker side and it‚Äôs equally important and very difficult to manage. And that What If is ultimately about managing risk. There are many kinds of risk that one might face: competitive risk, customer churn risk, adoption risk, data risk, execution risk, partner risk, technical risk, and the "unknown, unknown" risks (aka "blast radius"). I'll write another post about managing each of these risks one day, but orienting yourself on this spectrum of What Ifs in the right moments is an art. Too much or too little of either do not deliver good outcomes. 

## An MBR a day keeps the doctor away üîé

Monthly Business Reviews are a huge pain. They are tedious to produce and can feel risky to publish because you're opening yourself up to scrutiny. However, I‚Äôve realized good reporting is essential - not only for external stakeholders but also it actually will make you better at your job. Here‚Äôs why. 
- `MBRs increase quality and accountability` This is obvious but it‚Äôs remarkable how effective it is. As soon as you make what you‚Äôre working on public and up for scrutiny and feedback, everyone takes it seriously. Showing your work to the rest of the organization elevates the quality of everyone's work and ensures that there is a culture where people take pride in their work.  
- `The clearest expression of a company's priorities` As organizations scale, there is more and more noise and therefore, more and more opportunities for distraction. A good MBR is a concrete artifact that is an tangible expression of a company's development priorities. Good reporting invites debate and adjustments if necessary; it minimizes the risk of misalignment which provides more predictability and clarity for everyone.
- `Leverages the wider business to accelerate R&D` Reporting gives R&D teams the opportunity to raise issues and get help. It‚Äôs a way expose latent issues that are creating friction. When these issues are exposed, solutioning can occur with the help of the entire business, rather than just the R&D teams. It also makes you feel less alone when facing really hard challenges.

## Create the spectre of Mutually Assured Inspiration üí°

Everyone in R&D must have enough context about the business, the customer and the technology for what I call Mutually Assured Inspiration. A silo'd team where engineers only know the tech, the designer knows the customer and the product person knows the business will result in bad outcomes, bad collaboration and bad morale. Here's why:
- `Shared context breeds better ideas` - MORE TO COME 
- `Product development is more fun when it's inclusive` - MORE TO COME 
- `Respect for each other's disciplines creates better morale` - MORE TO COME 
- `Better long-term tech and business strategy decisions` - MORE TO COME 

I believe it's a critical role for the PM to model and promote behavior that creates the conditions for Mutually Assured Inspiration. 

## Getting on and off the Tradeoff Treadmill üèÉ

The tradeoff treadmill is a symptom of a weak product vision or North Star.

- MORE TO COME
- Will talk about short-term optimizations
- Micro ROI tradeoffs
- Value engineering to death 
- The impact on morale
