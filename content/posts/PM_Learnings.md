DRAFT COMING!

A observations that I've had during my time in product. This post is not about the craft of product. The actual product work is just a portion of the product management role - especially in a scaling organizations. 

## Getting on and off the tradeoff treadmill 

This section will be about how to feel like you're progressing - even when it's like you're on a neverend tradeoff treadmill.

## Managing Product is Managing People 

This section will be about the importance of team dynamics and how the particular role of product requires a signifianct amount of flexibility. It's more of a triumverate of design, business and technology >> and these skills need to somehow be filled in.

## MBRs are a secret weapon 

Business reviews can be a huge pain. It can be very tedious (especially if you don't have good procesess or tools). And it can also feel very vulnerable because in some respect you're opening up yourself and team to critique and scrutiny. However, I’ve realized good reporting, good communication from the product teams to the rest of the business is essential - not only for external stakeholders but also it actually will make you better at your job. Here’s why. 

- *Keeps the team accountable.* This is obvious but it’s remarkable how effective it is. As soon as you make what you’re working on public and up for scrutiny and feedback, everyone takes it seriously. Engineers put more time into their swags; they take their delivery dates more seriously. PMs take more time articulating the strategy and risks. Showing your work to the rest of the organization elevates the quality of your work.
- *Ensures alignment with the business.* As organizations scale, there is more and more noise (i.e., more opportunities to get distracted and derailed). A good MBR is a concrete artifact that is an undeniable prioritization of activities for the most expensive team in a tech org - engineers. It is the clearest expression of what the organization is prioritizing - which customers are being served and which ones being sidelined. Good reporting gives the space to debate and calibrate if necessary. And because the reporting is accessible to all - the goal is to avoid unnecessary churn from misaligment before it's too late in the product development process.
- *Harnesses the business behind the R&D team.* Reporting gives R&D teams the opportunity to raise issues and get help from the business. This was an aspect that I didn’t fully appreciate. It’s a way expose latent issues that are creating friction in strategy, friction in productivity, among other things. When these issues are exposed, solutions can be generated (with the help of the business) - instead of R&D trying to figure them out internally. But more emotionally, it makes you feel less alone when facing really hard tradeoffs. If you call for help, it will come. 

## The importance of bringing people into your tent 

A PM’s job is about leveraging the best ideas in an organization, extracting insight into a coherent product story, and replaying that story back into the org and then building a coalition around that story.

Product managemenet is not a lone genius role. There's too much work and too many people you need to help carry out the goal. You may be a product genius but you won't be successulf if the you don't have a coalition that is not zealously behind your ideas. Here are a few ways I brought people into my tent at Juniper Square: 
- *Listen for needles* To come  
- *Good ideas can come from anyone and anywhere* To come
- *Telegraph your synthesis and ideas* To come
- *Engage and promote missionaries* To come

## The Whatifs 

A key aspect of being a good PM is what I call managing the **What Ifs**. When I worked at frog design, we loved using What If statements (aka “how might we”). In fact, one of our competitors was named What If. The question “What if” is a common tactic in innovation - a way to elicit ideas by lowering the stakes. When you give people an hypothetical, it's amazing how much more generative people can be with that prompt.

But there is another kind of What if. The darker side and it’s equally important. And that what if is ultimately about managing risk. Building products is rife with risk in every direction. There are some of the more straightforward business risks - customer churn risk, adoption risk, market risk. I won’t go into these areas because they are commonly known. The risks are also very multi-dimensional and there is no way a PM can really prepare for every possible situation.
