This post is not about the craft of product or human centered design. The following are some reflections and principles that I have taken away from my time being a product manager at a scaling startup.

## Adopt a "big tent" strategy 🎪

In politics, the concept of a "big tent" refers to how a political party attracts a wide range of supporters from various backgrounds, beliefs, and ideologies, attempting to unite individuals under a broad coalition. I think PMs should have similar aspirations - to create a big tent for their initiatives - that amass support from across an organization. 

You can apply a "big tent" approach across the product development cycle. Ultimately it's about how you build a zealous group of supporters for your roadmap to help drive business value.
Here are a few ways I brought people into my tent at Juniper Square: 
- *Good ideas can come from anyone and anywhere* Open yourself up to ideas from all levesl of the organization from support to sales. Create a process that invites participation from the rest of the org.
- *Telegraph and evolve your point of view* Document, share and evangelize your perspective. Ensure that everyone else buys into the direction.
- *Multiply your voice with missionaries* Provide artifacts or create moments where you leverage others to share and promulgate your ideas. Ideas become stronger when they are not only conveyed by you but also repeated by others.

## The Whatifs: Balancing Risk and Reward ⚖️    

In design consulting, a common tactic to generate new ideas is called the What If technique (it's also known as "how might we..."). The technique is used to help expand the scope of thinking, challenge existing rules, elicit more divergent ideas by lower the stakes and offering a hypothetical. This kind of What if is the fun and happy kind. 

But there is another kind of What if. The darker side and it’s equally important. And that what if is ultimately about managing risk. Building products is risky business. And a critical element of the product role is about managing risk. There are many kinds of risk that you might face: competitive risk, customer churn risk, adoption risk, data risk, project execution risk, partner risk, technical / product risk (i.e., "blast radius").

The tension between What Ifs is extremely challenging to manage because you have to orient yourself to where on the What If scale you should be depending on the context. Too much or too little of either do not deliver good outcomes. 

## MBRs for the Win 🔎

Monthly Business Reviews are a huge pain. They are tedious to produce and can feel risky to publish because you're opening up yourself and team to critique and scrutiny. However, I’ve realized good reporting is essential - not only for external stakeholders but also it actually will make you better at your job. Here’s why. 
- *Keeps the team accountable.* This is obvious but it’s remarkable how effective it is. As soon as you make what you’re working on public and up for scrutiny and feedback, everyone takes it seriously. Showing your work to the rest of the organization elevates the quality of everyone's work and ensures that there is a culture where people take pride in their work.  
- *Ensures alignment with the business.* As organizations scale, there is more and more noise and therefore, more and more opportunities for distraction and derailment. A good MBR is a concrete artifact that is an undeniable prioritization of activities for the most expensive team in a tech org - engineers. It is the clearest expression of what the organization values. Good reporting gives the space to debate and adjust if necessary. Good consistent reporting minimizes the risk of misalignment which provides more predictability and clarity for eveyrone (hopefully fewer disurptive pivots which can affect morale).
- *Harnesses the business behind the R&D team.* Reporting gives R&D teams the opportunity to raise issues and get help from the business. It’s a way expose latent issues that are creating friction. When these issues are exposed, solutioning can occur with the help of the entire business, rather than just the R&D teams. It also makes you feel less alone when facing really hard tradeoffs.

## Create the spectre of Mutually Assured Inspiration 💡

Everyone in R&D has to have enough context about the business, the customer and the technology for Mutually Assured Inspiration. A team where the engineers only know the tech, the designer knows the customer and the product person knows the business will result in bad outcomes and bad collaboration. Here's why:
- Everyone should be able to riff on ideas
- MORE TO COME 

I believe it's the PMs job to figure out how you create the conditions for Mutually Assured Inspiration. 

## Getting on and off the Tradeoff Treadmill 🏃

This section will be about the importance of team dynamics and how the particular role of product requires a signifianct amount of flexibility. It's more of a triumverate of design, business and technology >> and these skills need to somehow be filled in.

- MORE TO COME
- A Product Manager (PM) should focus on guiding the long-term vision of a product, based on market opportunities and business analysis, rather than just immediate costs. This vision, which aligns with the overall corporate strategy, should be revisited every six months, but is expected to remain relatively stable. Without such a framework, there's a risk of falling into a cycle of focusing only on short-term Return on Investment (ROI) optimizations, which typically favor improvements for existing customers over attracting new ones, due to their lower risk and ease of justification. Having a clear, long-term vision is crucial for guiding strategic product directions and providing engineers with a sense of purpose and direction. This vision should be communicated across all levels of the organization to ensure that decisions, including those related to Value Engineering (VE) and implementation, align with the broader organizational goals.
