I believe that LLMs and AI will dramatically reduce the costs to creativity. I don't mean creativity in the "be a designer" perspectve. I mean to be a creator of something. To envison and realize an idea - your own idea - indepedently. And this is exciting. 

I wanted to reference a few articles around 
  
`All you need is curiosity` (the essential human characteristic)
- Reference to [Attention is all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)

What is amazing about an LLM is it is a limitless tutor with no bounds. You can go as deep as you want on a topic. You can ask dumb questions. When it presents you with a piece of jargon or term that you don't know, you can ask it to pause and explain it. And when it explains to to you - you can incrasingly ask it to dumb it more and more. You can ask it to give more exampples. If you're the cusp of grasping a concept, you can semi articulate in words you might not feel comfortable sharing in a more public setting, and the LLM will say yes you're on the right track or no, it's more like this. 

Curiosity (depth, context and modeling)


`Prompting a Process` (brainstorming, definition, specification, implementation)
This is how I used GPT
- Step 1: Prompt it to brainstorm and ask follow up questions. In all of my projects, I would start with a vague idea with some aspect of AI technology that I wanted to learn (for exmaple: " ")
  - GPT is extraodinarily good at coming up with thought provoking ideas.
- Step 2: Partner with GPT to help make your idea more concrete. This usually was an iterative process. You want to get to a place where GPT understands the goal of the project so that you can basically create a product spec.
- Step 3: Create a product spec with the help of GPT that articulates the features of the project. GPT can help you brainstorm what are the most important aspects based on Step 2.
- Step 4: Prompt GPT to help you create a tech / architecture spec. As part fo this process, you will need to give it some more context about your technical know-how, time commitment and also whether this app is a proof of concept. 
- Step 5: Iterate on the tech spec to ensure that it meets your level. Give it context about yourself so that it can tailor the best way to implment. 
- Step 6: Start implementation but ask GPT to help you decide where to start. 
MORE TO COME.

If you need more guidance tell it. 
GPT can tailor its response to the way you want to learn.

`What will win?` (The primary factor influencing widespread job displacement will be the competition between human curiosity and the capitalist drive to automate.)
