**DRAFT COMING**

`Boundless Creativity` 

GenAI will dramatically reduce the barriers to creativity. I don't mean creativity in the sense of the creative profession (i.e. designers and artists) although it will have tremendous impact there too. I mean creativity in the sense of the act of creation - the ability to envison and realize an idea - your own idea - independently. 
  
`Curiosity is all you need` 

And the starting point to this new potential for creation starts with a human quality - curiosity.

For me, LLMs (and in particular GPT) have sparked a new enthusiasm and energy for learning and creation. Any topic, any thread, any thought, any idea has limitless potential if you are curious enough to see it through.

In high school, I was given a science award for being the most inquisitive. I would often annoy teachers with my questions - some of which were dumb, sometimes repetitive, and perhaps distracting - but they were an essential part of the way I learned. My questions were the result of how my brain was trying to form and validate my mental model of a concept. GPT is a teacher with no boundaries. It doesn't judge, it comes along with you on your learning journey and it never tires. It provides more agency to the user in how they want to learn. Need more examples? Need analogies to help you connect the dots? GPT will tailor its explanation of concepts to your context. 

Over a period of 6 weeks, I built seven apps that started with basic scripts adn culminated in a reinforcement learning news experience that had a React front end, python backend and a SQL database. I built this website using the static-site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and to streamline the process, I implemented a CI/CD pipeline using Github actions. I did all of ths without watching a single youtube video or tutorial (the only external resource that I used was reading the documentation when necesary)

 My only tool was curiosity and the patience to iterate my prompts so that GPT or co-pilot eventually understood my intent. Prompting an AI can be frustrating but its far less tedious than scrolling through stackoverflow and community boards to get help. Iterating a prompt is actually quite fun because the feedback loop is so fast - you give it an input and it provides a response - and you can see instantly whether it's "aligned to your intention." 

`Prompting a Process` (brainstorming, definition, specification, implementation)
This is how I used GPT
- Step 1: Prompt it to brainstorm and ask follow up questions. In all of my projects, I would start with a vague idea with some aspect of AI technology that I wanted to learn (for exmaple: " ")
  - GPT is extraodinarily good at coming up with thought provoking ideas.
- Step 2: Partner with GPT to help make your idea more concrete. This usually was an iterative process. You want to get to a place where GPT understands the goal of the project so that you can basically create a product spec.
- Step 3: Create a product spec with the help of GPT that articulates the features of the project. GPT can help you brainstorm what are the most important aspects based on Step 2.
- Step 4: Prompt GPT to help you create a tech / architecture spec. As part fo this process, you will need to give it some more context about your technical know-how, time commitment and also whether this app is a proof of concept. 
- Step 5: Iterate on the tech spec to ensure that it meets your level. Give it context about yourself so that it can tailor the best way to implment. 
- Step 6: Start implementation but ask GPT to help you decide where to start. 
MORE TO COME.

If you need more guidance tell it. 
GPT can tailor its response to the way you want to learn.
