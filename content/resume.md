## My Story
My unconventional career path has taken me from private equity investing to design consulting to tech product management. These experiences give me an extremely broad toolkit of skills and languages to draw from when facing different contexts and types of people.

- `High Learning Capacity` - My ability to learn and adapt has enabled me to build trust and gain expertise repeatedly across multiple industries and roles.
- `Quantitive Approach` - My background in finance and investing naturally inclines me towards working with data, metrics, projections, and business case/ROI analyses. 
- `User Empathy` - I have significant experience running user research and design procesess honed repeatedly over multiple consulting engagements across the product lifecycle.
- `Polished Storytelling` - I am known for my skill in crafting compelling narratives and presentations, a skill that I developed from my business development responsibilities at frog.
- `Technical Curiosity` - At Juniper Square, I collaborated closely with engineers on some of the most technical aspects of our core data model. I have a passion for understanding complex systems and getting my hands dirty as exemplified by some of my recent AI prototypes.
