      <description>Anyone can create GenAI dramatically reduces the barriers to creativity. I&amp;rsquo;m not referring solely to creativity within professional fields like design and art, although it will undoubtedly have a substantial impact there as well. What I mean is creativity in its broadest senseâ€”the act of envisioning and bringing an idea to life, your own idea, independently.
Curiosity is all you need For me, GPT has sparked a new enthusiasm and energy for learning and creation.</description>

      <description>My motiviation behind these experiments I was curious about the hype around GenAI so I wanted to play with the technology firsthand. Here are a few examples of what I created. Each of these applications was built with the assistance of GPT or Github Co-Pilot.
Learn that Law: An Example of Retrieval Augmentation Generation My first project was to build a simple RAG which is the basis of many LLM use cases that enable users to query an external data source with natural language.</description>

      <description>My motivation behind these experiments After reading the Alignment Problem and taking a deep learning class from fast.ai. I was interested in learning how some of the learning methods worked in practice.
Training my own Neural Net My goal was to see an end-to-end machine learning workflow. I used the FastAI library for its ease of use. I found a dataset available from Harvard. The Annotated Image Database of Architecture is comprised of about 15,000 images that are pre-labeled across various categories including building type and location.</description>

      <description>The following are some reflections and principles that I have taken away from my time being a product manager at a scaling startup.
Create the spectre of Mutually Assured Inspiration ðŸ’¡ Everyone in R&amp;amp;D must have enough context about the business, the customer and the technology. This trifecta of knowledge forms the Context Triad, which is essential for fostering Mutually Assured Inspiration. A silo&amp;rsquo;d team where engineers only know the tech, the designer knows the customer and the product person knows the business is not only bad for the business, it&amp;rsquo;s not a fun way to collaborate.</description>

      <description>Loft view Collaboration During COVID, I collaborated with Hesselbrand to renovate my loft. Because the architect was based in London and Oslo, we used several techniques including 3D scans and models to communicate the design intent. As part of the Hesselbrand team, I led the permitting and execution of this project.
Context The Clocktower Building, located in the South Beach neighbourhood of San Francisco, is one of the city&amp;rsquo;s iconic landmarks.</description>
