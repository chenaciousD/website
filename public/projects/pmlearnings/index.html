It&rsquo;s the Context Triad necessary to create Mutually Assured Inspiration. A silo&rsquo;d team where engineers only know the tech, the designer knows the customer and the product person knows the business is not only bad for the business, it&rsquo;s not a fun way to collaborate. Here&rsquo;s why:</p><ul><li><code>Shared context breeds better ideas and greater efficiency</code> - A strong foundational understanding and curiosity for the Triad across the team results in better brainstorming, less documentation and faster decisions. It does take some dedication for everyone to ramp up - this is especially challenging in niche B2B businesses - but the return far outweighs the effort.</li><li><code>Product development is more fun when it's inclusive</code> - When there is shared context, more of the team can participate in the product development process (rather than a more waterfall top down approach). More participation means greater feeling of ownership and control. More cross functional understanding also results in mutual respect. More respect translates to better morale and team dynamics.</li><li><code>Better long-term tech and business strategy decisions</code> - Mutually Assured Inspiration increases the likelihood that implementation is right-sized for the business. It also ensures that different disciplines can advocate for each other&rsquo;s respective agendas. Everyone on the team should be able to confidently rationalize and explain in reasonable detail the business value of a project.</li></ul><p>I believe it&rsquo;s a critical role for the PM to model and promote behavior that creates the conditions for Mutually Assured Inspiration.</p><h2 id=adopt-a-big-tent-strategy->Adopt a &ldquo;big tent&rdquo; strategy ðŸŽª</h2><p>In politics, the concept of a &ldquo;big tent&rdquo; refers to how a political party attracts a wide range of supporters from various backgrounds, beliefs, and ideologies, attempting to unite individuals under a broad coalition. I think PMs should have similar aspirations - to create a big tent for their initiatives that amass zealous support across an organization.</p><p>You can apply a &ldquo;big tent&rdquo; approach across the product development cycle. Here are a few ways I brought people into my tent at Juniper Square:</p><ul><li><code>Good ideas come from anyone and anywhere</code> Open yourself up to ideas from all parts of the organization. Create a process that invites participation and engagement.</li><li><code>Telegraph your voice</code> The PM is a very well positioned role because it by definition is networked across sales, success, support, engineering etc. Making sense of these signals is step one but evangelizing your synthesis is even more important. People need to know where you stand.</li><li><code>Multiply your voice with missionaries</code> Ideas become stronger when they are not only conveyed by you but also repeated by others. Provide artifacts or create moments where you can leverage others to promulgate your ideas.</li></ul><h2 id=building-trust-through-better-reporting->Building trust through better reporting ðŸ”Ž</h2><p>Monthly Business Reviews are a huge pain. They are tedious to produce and can feel risky to publish because you&rsquo;re opening yourself up to scrutiny. However, Iâ€™ve realized good reporting is essential - not only for external stakeholders in terms of trust-building but also it actually will make you better at your job. Hereâ€™s why.</p><ul><li><code>MBRs increase quality and accountability</code> This is obvious but itâ€™s remarkable how effective it is. As soon as you publicize what youâ€™re working on, everyone takes it more seriously. Showing your work to the rest of the organization elevates the quality of everyone&rsquo;s work.</li><li><code>The clearest expression of a company's priorities</code> As organizations scale, there is more and more noise and therefore, more and more opportunities for distraction. Good reporting creates a tangible expression of a company&rsquo;s development priorities and invites debate and adjustments if necessary, thereby minimizing the risk of misalignment before it&rsquo;s too late. People want predictability.</li><li><code>Leverages the wider business to accelerate R&amp;D</code> Reporting gives R&amp;D teams the opportunity to raise issues and get help. Itâ€™s a way expose latent issues that are creating friction. When these issues are exposed, solutioning can occur with the help of the entire business, rather than just the R&amp;D teams.</li></ul><h2 id=next-topics-up>Next Topics Up</h2><ul><li>The Continuum of What Ifs: Managing Reward and Risk</li><li>The Tradeoff Treadmill: The Importance of Vision combined with ROI analysis</li></ul></section><div class=post-tags></div></article></main><footer><div style=display:flex><a class=soc href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/chenaciousd/ rel=me title=Linkedin><i data-feather=linkedin></i></a>
